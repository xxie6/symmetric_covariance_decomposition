The results in this page were generated with repository version

See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.

<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .DS_Store
    Ignored:    .Rhistory

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not
included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to
have uncommitted changes.

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In this analysis, I want to test out initializing symEBcovMF with a
binary prior with a point-exponential symEBcovMF fit.</p>
<div id="motivation" class="section level2">
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>In the tree setting, I found that symEBcovMF with the
point-exponential prior did a better job at recovering tree structure
than symEBcovMF with the generalized binary prior. Matthew and I
hypothesized that the point-exponential prior is better at finding
sparse solutions. So we want to investigate a two-step procedure which
finds a fit with point-exponential prior in the first step, and then
refines the fit with the generalized binary (or other binary) prior in
the second step. In this analysis, I investigate a backfitting procedure
– first, I generate a fit with a point-exponential prior, and then use
that as an initialization for a backfit with a binary prior.</p>

<h2>Observations</h2>
<p>The estimate from the backfit procedure looks closer to the
tree-structured loadings matrix than the estimate from greedy
generalized binary symEBcovMF. Furthermore, the backfit procedure
attains a much higher objective function value. This suggests that the
method does prefer the tree-structured loadings matrix, and the greedy
generalized binary symEBcovMF method has a convergence issue. The second
factor corresponding to a subtype effect could be more binary. This
could potentially be fixed by using a more strict binary prior.
Similarly, the first factor corresponding to the intercept could be more
binary. Another observation is the single group effect factors all have
a couple of small, non-zero loading values. I’m not exactly sure why
those appear.</p>

<h2>Observations</h2>
<p>Similar to generalized binary symEBcovMF, the binormal symEBcovMF
method fails to find all four single group effect factors. Instead,
three of the factors combine two groups. The backfit procedure does a
better job at recovering the tree structure in the data. Furthermore,
the estimate from the backfit procedure attains a higher objective
function value than the estimate from the greedy procedure. Comparing
the binormal prior with the generalized binary prior, we see that the
factors generated from the latter look more binary. Though this could be
due to the settings of the priors. I’m guessing it would be possible to
get a more binary estimate from the generalized binary prior by changing
the scale parameter.</p>
