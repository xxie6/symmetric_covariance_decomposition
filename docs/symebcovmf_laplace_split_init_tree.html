Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development
and connecting the code version to the results is critical for
reproducibility.

The results in this page were generated with repository version
<a href="https://github.com/xxie6/symmetric_covariance_decomposition/tree/c9e74f51c31c4865e541531b151c2bf8e00c47f4" target="_blank">c9e74f5</a>.
See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .DS_Store
    Ignored:    .Rhistory

Untracked files:
    Untracked:  analysis/symebcovmf_laplace_exploration.Rmd

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not
included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to
have uncommitted changes.

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In this analysis, we explore symEBcovMF with the GBCD initialization
procedure – fitting with point-Laplace prior and then splitting the
matrices into the negative and non-negative parts – in the tree
setting.</p>
<div id="motivation" class="section level2">
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>We are interested in this procedure because it is the initialization
procedure for GBCD, and it seems to work well empirically. We are
interested in whether this procedure also works well for symEBcovMF.
There isn’t much justification for this procedure beyond Jason’s work
with divergence factorizations in the tree setting.</p>

<h1>Backfit with Split Initialization</h1>
<p>Now, we backfit from the split initialization (this is what GBCD
does). The backfit is run with the point-exponential prior.</p>
<p>First, we initialize a symEBcovMF object using <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{L}_{split}\)</span>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>symebcovmf_laplace_split_init_obj &lt;- sym_ebcovmf_init(sim_data$YYt)

split_L_norms &lt;- apply(LL_split_init, 2, function(x){sqrt(sum(x^2))})
idx.keep &lt;- which(split_L_norms &gt; 0)
split_L_normalized &lt;- apply(LL_split_init[,idx.keep], 2, function(x){x/sqrt(sum(x^2))})
symebcovmf_laplace_split_init_obj$L_pm &lt;- split_L_normalized

symebcovmf_laplace_split_init_obj$lambda &lt;- rep(symebcovmf_fit$lambda, times = 2)[idx.keep]

symebcovmf_laplace_split_init_obj$resid_s2 &lt;- estimate_resid_s2(S = sim_data$YYt, 
  L = symebcovmf_laplace_split_init_obj$L_pm, 
  lambda = symebcovmf_laplace_split_init_obj$lambda, 
  n = nrow(sim_data$Y), 
  K = length(symebcovmf_laplace_split_init_obj$lambda))

symebcovmf_laplace_split_init_obj$elbo &lt;- compute_elbo(S = sim_data$YYt, 
  L = symebcovmf_laplace_split_init_obj$L_pm, 
  lambda = symebcovmf_laplace_split_init_obj$lambda, 
  resid_s2 = symebcovmf_laplace_split_init_obj$resid_s2, 
  n = nrow(sim_data$Y), 
  K = length(symebcovmf_laplace_split_init_obj$lambda), 
  KL = rep(0, length(symebcovmf_laplace_split_init_obj$lambda)))</code></pre>
<p>I refit the lambda values keeping the factors fixed.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># need to check this
symebcovmf_laplace_split_obj &lt;- refit_lambda(S = sim_data$YYt, symebcovmf_laplace_split_init_obj, maxiter = 500)</code></pre>
<p>Now, we run the backfit with point-exponential prior.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>symebcovmf_laplace_split_init_backfit &lt;- sym_ebcovmf_backfit(sim_data$YYt, symebcovmf_laplace_split_init_obj, ebnm_fn = ebnm::ebnm_point_exponential, backfit_maxiter = 500)</code></pre>

<h1>Observations</h1>
<p>We see that this procedure does not yield a tree-structured estimate.
Instead of four single population effect factors, we have four factors
each containing two population effects. The estimated Gram matrix looks
close to the observed Gram matrix, suggesting an identifiability issue.
This is a well-known issue with the tree setting. Given that the
point-Laplace initialization did not recover the divergence
factorization, it is not surprising to me that the method did not
recover a tree. For the GBCD method, the point-Laplace fit after
backfitting is able to recover the divergence factorization (the greedy
point-Laplace fit alone does not recover the factorization).</p>

<p>This has a higher objective function value. This suggests that the
greedy procedure prefers the estimate from the default initialization.
However, the previous section suggests that for overall fit, the
objective function prefers the sparser representation. So the greedy
method may not be the way to attain the sparser representation?</p>

<!-- Adjust MathJax settings so that all math formulae are shown using
TeX fonts only; see
https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/web/configuration.html. This will make
the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
footer is added to webpages before the MathJax javascript. -->
